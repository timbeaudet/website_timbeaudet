<p>The confederates are coming, wait now come the allies!  Time travel can be a great fun, and the ideas behind Darkest of Days were amazing.  Granted some of them weren't pulled off how the team wanted, but the game moved on anyways despite minor changes.  I came onto the project mid-way through development, the engine was already working well and habitat, the level editor, was a tad unstable.  I was thrown into the unknown on the largest code base I had seen as a programmer, but I pushed that aside and did my tasks.</p>
<p>Habitat's instability kept me busy for my first few months, fixing little quirks and adding new features as the designers would request them.  My tasks changed gears to get the game prepared for release.  By adding a threaded file-archive to reduce the space requirements and improve loading speeds dramatically.  During the final part of development the HUD needed a visual and behavioral overhaul to add fading elements and show only what is required or changing.</P>

    <p>Probably one of my favorite games to work on as I enjoy the strategy side of things.  It also presented me with new design issues, and I was in control of a majority of the code design from the ground up.  The only flaw I would say was learning Objective C and the iPhone framework while designing the code.  I was attempting to finish the project before I left for a life-adventure, however knowing that might not be possible I focused on as many features as I could while keeping everything data driven.  Even the user interface is done by scripts that a non-programmer could handle.  Levels, upgrades, unlocks, enemies and towers were also scripted.  I am glad to see this projected completed, it was a blast to work on.</p>

    <p>Worked off-site for a month or so on a prototype for a train puzzle game.  This prototype was designed as such, quick code and eventually a small editor was added.  A year later I do some more off-site work, since the game was now in development for the iPhone.  The prototype jumped to become the game engine powering the project.  Added more features and editing tools while another member of Stratogon handled porting the code from PC to iPhone.</p>

    <p>Sound is important in games that is often overlooked until the end.  For the Lost Treasures of Alexandria, I implemented basic sound support for the project.  Because of the aimed market, download-able games, a small memory footprint for download size was a priority.  For that reason ogg files were chosen for their quality and size.  Using <A HREF="http://www.vorbis.com/">Ogg Vorbis</A> I implemented basic sound effects and streaming music that fit the needs of the project.</p>

This was great because I could shake hands and meet the person who got me started.  As he shook my hand he looks at me and asked if I wanted a job, on-site for a couple of months.  I was astonished, the project was A.R.C. Angels, where a team of four or five programmers spent a few months in crunch mode.</p>
<p>None of us knew the language, C#.  None of us knew the framework XNA.  But we all did our parts and created a project.  My tasks ranged from implementing player physics, to gameplay bits.  From input with force feed-back to a world that maintains enemies and that object structure.</P>

	After only two years of hard work I graduated from Full Sail Real World Entertainment, with a four year degree.  The accelerated program taught all aspects of developing and designing video games; something I've dreamt of since before high-school.  The minimal time not spent on school work was spent programming full bore on miniture side projects to apply the techniques first hand.</p>
